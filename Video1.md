# Video-1-SQL Connects:
### Database->
Colection of interrelated data
### DBMS

It's a record keeping system which handles a database and it's operation

## Data Independence:
- it defines that we can make changes to data of any label without affecting any oher label
- **Types**-   i) Physical Data Independence ii) Logical data Independence

---

## Relations
- Collection of data in the form of table(rows-columns)
- **Cardinality**->Total no of rows
- **Degree**->toal number of Columns

---
## Keys-> 
> Primary, candidate, Alternative (**You Know about keys**)

> **Foreign Key**
- it's attritbute or set f attribute of any relation which serves as primary key of another relation

- Primary key defines data integritiy and Foreign key defines referential integritiy

## Relational Algebra:
- based on set-theory
- it's the algebra performed on relations

### Operators in Relational algb.
- **σ** to select tuples
- **π** to select attributes(column)
- **X** to find cartesian Product of 2 relations

### Union Operations:(U)
can be applied only if
- degree of both relaions are same
- every attr of 2 relations are same

### Set Diff:
Condititons same as Union
- **A-B** defines tuples present in A but not in B

### Set Intersection :
Conditions are same
- **∩** , **X∩Y** defines common tuples
